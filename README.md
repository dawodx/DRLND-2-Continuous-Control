# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

In this project I share my solution for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 2 - Continuous Control [The Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.



### Solving the Environment

We used the method of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to solve this project.

In this Project we tackeled the second environment Version : Multiaple Agents
We trained 20 agents over 100 consecutive episodes with an average scores of +37.
 

### Getting Started

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Clone the Udacity Deep Reinforcment Learning repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

4. Clone this repository and open a new notebook and open the file `Continuous_Control-ddpg.ipynb`


5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.

6. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

7. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `DRLND-2-Continuous-Control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Continuous_Control-ddpg.ipynb` to run the agent training or to load and run the agent using the pretrained model!
